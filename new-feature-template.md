# Write your own new feature documentation

To have the docs team create documentation for your new feature: 

1. Fill out this template
2. Create a new page on [Internal drafts](https://www.notion.so/astronomerio/Internal-Drafts-e09f6e1e64464f1cb4b3468a549bb45f)
3. Copy the template into your new page 

## What is the name of your feature? If it doesn't have a name, what's the tagline?

## What is the purpose of the feature? 

## What problems does it solve? What new possibilities does it enable for customers.

## Who is the feature for? For example, “An advanced data practitioner who wants to view code changes between DAG versions”

## If applicable, write a numbered procedure for how a user turns on or uses the feature. Don’t worry about style or layout. Try and capture each action that the user must complete to implement the feature successfully. 

## Will the implementation of the feature cause automatic or breaking changes for existing users or Deployments? If so, what are they? 

## What are the primary GitHub issues, PRs, or internal Notion documents that the docs team should review to learn more about the feature? Provide links to the relevant source material here.
