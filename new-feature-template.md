To have the docs team create documentation for your new feature: 

1. Complete this template.

2. Add a new page to [Internal drafts](https://www.notion.so/astronomerio/Internal-Drafts-e09f6e1e64464f1cb4b3468a549bb45f).

3. Copy and paste the completed template into your new page.

4. Notify the docs team when your content is ready for review.


## What is the name of your feature? If it doesn't have a name, what's the tagline?

## What is the purpose of the feature? 

## What problems does it solve? What will it allow customers to accomplish?


## Who is the intended audience of the feature? For example, “An advanced data practitioner who wants to view code changes between DAG versions”


## If applicable, write a numbered procedure for how a user configures or implements the feature. Don’t worry about style or layout. Try and capture each action that is necessary for success. 


## Will the implementation of the feature cause automatic or breaking changes for existing users or Deployments? If so, what are they? 

## What are the primary GitHub issues, PRs, or internal Notion documents that the docs team should review to learn more about the feature? Provide links to the relevant source material here.
